#   TOP=/mnt/Data/lineage-23.2 (default)   STATUS=0 skips the slow `repo status`
#
# Checks, each one a trap met before:
#   1. every manifest project has a worktree whose HEAD resolves
#   2. every project is still shallow (a retry into a half-fetched dir goes full depth)
#   3. git-lfs payloads are real files, not pointers (chromium-webview came EMPTY 08-18)
#   4. no tmp_pack_* left by a stalled fetch (stale ones are deleted only after 1-2 pass)
#   5. AICP, not LineageOS, owns build/make + build/soong (re-pointed checkout, 11-12 (g))
#   6. `repo status`: no torn worktree (a power cut can tear a checkout without touching its gitdir);
#      a build host's own patch passes only on an exact per-file diff hash (tools/host-patches.txt)
