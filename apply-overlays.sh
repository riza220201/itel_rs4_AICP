# WHAT BELONGS HERE, AND WHAT DOES NOT (as in the crDroid recipe)
#   Device facts live in the three repos -- device_itel_S666LN, -kernel, vendor --
#   on branch lineage-23.2. This file holds only what is AICP's: ROM identity,
#   signing, app choices, patches to AICP's own forks. That split matters more on
#   this tree than it did on crDroid: the vendor is a SHARED base for AICP, the
#   OriginOS / One UI ports and AOSPA (decided 2026-11-12), so anything
#   AICP-only that leaks into the device repos travels to systems that are not AICP.
#
# STEP NUMBERS ARE NEVER RENUMBERED. Records refer to steps by number; a
# withdrawn step keeps its number and becomes a documented no-op.

# (2026-11-12: a public clone must build, and there is no from-source
# fallback), so the import happens once, in the package, by the device tree's
# import-kernel.sh -- which proves the Image is the one inside the published
# boot image and runs the KMI gate on both module sets. This step re-checks the
# result on every run: the three files are present, still hash to what
# IMPORTED recorded, came from a PUBLISHED image, and are committed.
# BoardConfig.mk $(error)s without them anyway; this says why, earlier.
