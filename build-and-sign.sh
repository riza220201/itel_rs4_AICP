#   SIGN=1   release-sign after the build. NOT WRITTEN YET: test builds are test-keys,
#            and release keys stay out of the recipe until a release is decided.
#   Every aicp-build.sh variable (TOP, OUT_TARGET, PRODUCT, RELEASE, VARIANT, GOAL, DIRTY_OK)
#   passes through.
#   WITH_ADB_INSECURE=true   AICP's own switch (vendor/aicp/config/common.mk): ro.debuggable=1,
#            adb on at boot, NO authorisation. For bring-up on a phone with no usable screen only:
#            the zip is renamed *-BRINGUP-ADBINSECURE.zip and must never be released.
#            Without it, AICP userdebug = ro.debuggable=0 + ro.adb.secure=1 (adb off on a fresh /data).
#            Either way the built props are checked against the mode asked for.
#
# WHY (crDroid recipe, 08-19 / 08-28): the steps were correct on paper and nowhere
# executable, and a build ran on a tree that no longer matched git. So verification comes
# first and the script REFUSES to build when it fails. Any exit leaves a verdict: silence
# must never read as success.
