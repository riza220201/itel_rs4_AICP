#   PRODUCT=aicp_S666LN RELEASE=bp4a VARIANT=userdebug GOAL=bacon
#   DIRTY_OK=1                            build an uncommitted device tree (loud; never for a release)
#   KEEP_GOING=1                          m -k: build everything not behind a failure and report ALL
#                                         walls in one run (a first build's walls are independent)
#   JOBS=N                                m -jN (default: soong's own, nproc+2). On a SHARED server
#                                         set it: nproc there counts every tenant's cores, and the
#                                         per-user cgroup memory cap is what a -j192 link storm hits
#
# apply-overlays.sh MUST have been run against TOP first (build-and-sign.sh does both).
#
# GOAL=bacon is safe here, unlike crDroid 13: AICP's vendor/aicp/build/tasks/bacon.mk only
# hard-links the OTA package to $(AICP_VERSION).zip; it does NOT rm -rf the target-files
# (lineage-20's bacon.mk did, which is why the crDroid recipe built target-files-package).
#
# OUT: /mnt/Data holds the source (155 GB free after the sync); one A16 out was estimated at
# 130-180 GB (estimate of 2026-11-12), which leaves no margin there. /mnt/external_nvme (USB NVMe,
# ext4) had 256 GB free on 11-13. So the out dir lives there -- but as $TOP/out, a SYMLINK,
# with OUT_DIR left at its default. An absolute OUT_DIR outside the tree breaks soong:
#   platform_testing/Android.bp:728 "continuous_instrumentation_metric_tests": Path is outside
#   directory: /mnt/external_nvme/aicp-out/host/linux-x86/bin/perfetto_trace_processor_shell
# because build/soong/ci_tests/ci_test_package_zip.go:300 skips host files only when their path
# starts with "out" (it assumes OUT_DIR=out). Soong resolves a symlinked out itself
# (ui/build/sandbox_linux.go EvalSymlinks(outDir)).
#
# Every preflight below has cost a real build before (build-system gotchas,
# crDroid build-and-sign.sh, Advan 09-29).
